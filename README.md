Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of Genetics and Natural Selection. It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning.

These examples simply "evolves" the string "Hello, world!" from a population of random strings. It is intended to be a gentle introduction into the world of genetic algorithms, using python.
